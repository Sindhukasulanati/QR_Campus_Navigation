                    <h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
                    <p>Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology (VVIT) was established in the year 2007, with an intake of 240 students in four B. Tech programs under Social Educational Trust in Nambur village, Guntur, AP, by Er. Vasireddy Vidya Sagar. It is  located strategically between Guntur and Vijayawada in the capital region of Amaravati, AP.
